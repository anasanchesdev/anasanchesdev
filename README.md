Hello there, welcome to my profile!
I'm Ana Clara Sanches, 17 years old, and here I'll share my most interesting Python projects. I expect to learn more languages in the future.

My main goal is to make useful projects in which I can develop my programming and problem-solving skills.

Nowadays, I'm looking foward to learn more about Python Automation and Data Science.

Beginner in hacking (using python) and Linux

I speak portuguese (native) and english.

I'm open to any offers, sugestions or opportunities. Contact me at my e-mail.

Website: coming soon!
